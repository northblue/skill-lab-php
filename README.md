# Skill Lab for PHP


## Project Overview


In my journey to enhance coding skills, I've observed a lack of PHP solutions for a variety of online coding test questions. To bridge this gap, I've started this project to compile and practice PHP solutions for online quizzes, with a focus on problem-solving and algorithms.

## Purpose

This repository aims to be a resourceful collection for PHP developers looking to sharpen their skills through practical problem-solving. I hope this repository can save you a bit time and help you to become a better developer.
